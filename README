At the moment, the only thing here is a "null" Transport implementation for
JavaMail.  It doesn't transport mail at all; its purpose is to spy on code
that tries to send mail, for use in automated testing.  The point of it is to
test mail sending with no external processes and no cleanup, by capturing the
finished message and any other details of the sending.
